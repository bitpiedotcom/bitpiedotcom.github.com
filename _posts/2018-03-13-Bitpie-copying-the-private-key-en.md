Bitpie reminds you to backup 12 words. Did you do that? What will happen if you don’t backup the seed phrase?
```
In the cases that the seed phrase is lost, the seed phrase is backed up inappropriately or the phone installed Bitpie is lost, the cryptocurrencies will not be restored, simply speaking, the cryptocurrencies are lost!
If the seed phrase is disclosed or acquired by others, it is very possible the cryptocurrencies get transferred. Bitcoin is irreversible and anonymous. Once bitcoins are transferred, the probability to recover the coin is basically zero.
