Due to the design idea of EOS ecosystem, in the process of building the EOS architecture, many giveaways will be produced and airdropped to EOS holders.


There are majorly two approaches to secure EOS giveaways:<br/>
Approach 1: <br/>
You need to accomplish the EOS public key mapping; Tutorial on How to Carry Out EOS Mapping: <a href="http://docs.bitpie.com/en/latest/commonContract/index.html" target="_blank"  style="color:red">Click</a><br/>
Approach 2:<br/>
Snapshots to EOS holdersâ€™ addresses will be taken before the launch of the EOS mainnet, airdropping will be carried out as per the EOS numbers at the moment of snapshots, e.g., eosDAC.


Bitpie Wallet enables you to secure the airdropped tokens through the above either way:<br/>
1.For EOS holders whose EOS in the wallet account:<br/>
Regarding Approach 1: please accomplish EOS mapping, giveaways will be airdropped to your account.<br/>
Regarding Approach 2: please ensure you have EOS in Bitpie Wallet at the moment of snapshots.<br/>
Bitpie strongly recommends you to accomplish the EOS public key mapping before airdropping, in case you will miss the potential airdropping.<br/>
2.For EOS holders whose EOS in Pie Bank:<br/>
Bitpie will distribute you the tokens, and you do not need to do anything.<br/>

Fraud Alert: As the mainnet launching is approaching, many phishers are very active in various communities by taking advantage of this event. Once again, Bitpie Wallet reminds you that anyone which requires you to submit your private key/ seed phrase/mnemonic is a scammer!!!<br/>
Your support is highly appreciated.
